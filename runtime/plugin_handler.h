 *       It's up to this function to connect the objects in the plugin, whatever they are, into ART. 
 *       For instance, if the plugin shared library contains a Pass object, the init routine would probably want to call into art::PassDriver::HandleUserPass
 *             
 *       Currently there is no check on compatibility between the plugins and general libart.
 *       This should be done in a hand-shake manner where both libart and the plugin check if there are incompatibility issues.
